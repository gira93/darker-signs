Welcome to the Mother Network!

This is an hacking community open to hackers with the necessary skills,
after your excellent work with Zrio, we decided to call you in.

This is MotherOS, our creation, it connects to our network and grants you access to the real world.

Mother Network is divided into 3 main servers, we call it The Triad: Karma, Sutra and Warez;

- karma.mother.net is the assignments server, here you'll find new tasks to do and send already completed ones for review
- sutra.mother.net is a news servers, it's work in progress but you may find some cool articles in it
- warez.mother.net is a software server, nothing is free in the real world, you need credits to buy software here

How do you get credits? By completing tasks for us, of course!

You'll find a readme.txt file in the root of your OS, it explains how everything works here; read it,
then explore a bit, have a look at Sutra and Warez.

When you're ready, we have an easy job waiting for you just to get you started.
