MotherOS is no different than what you already used, all usual commands work (you can type "help" to see what's available);
There are some additions:

- "m", "c" and "s" are shorthands for "mail", "connect" and "scan";
  so you can type "s example.com" instead of "scan example.com"

- "tunnel" is a command that let's you connect to a server passing through a gateway,
  some servers won't accept public connections, if you receive an error, try searching
  for the correct gateway and use it with "tunnel [gateway server] [real server] [port]"

- "stats" is a command used to show your current credit balance and installed tools

Let's talk about tools.
Tools are used to hack servers or to defend against trace attacks,
the perfect hacker should have all the tools available, but tools are costly,
try to buy each version of every tool on Warez, you never know when it might be useful.

Using tools.
When you connect to a server and you have the correct tool, you'll see a message "[Tool] armed and ready!".
Defensive tool are automatically launched,
hacking or cracking tools need to be launched manually by typing the name of the tool in the "password" field

Examples:
You try connecting to test.com at port 21, it asks for user and password, you don't have any tool available.
Later you buy "rootbreaker", if you try reconnecting to test.com you'll see "rootbreaker armed and ready!".
Now you can type a username (try "admin" or "root" if you don't know a specific one)
and "rootbreaker" as password.
It will crack the account for you and also give you the clear text password for later use!
