MotherOS is no different than what you already used, all usual commands work (you can type "help" to see what's available);
There are some additions:

- "m", "c" and "s" are shorthands for "mail", "connect" and "scan";
  so you can type "s example.com" instead of "scan example.com"

- "tunnel" is a command that let you connect to a server passing through a gateway,
  some servers won't accept public connections, if you receive an error, try looking around
  for the correct gateway and use it with "tunnel [gateway server] [real server] [port]"

- "stats" is a command used to show your current credit balance and installed tools

Let's talk about tools.
Tools are used to hack servers or to defend against trace attacks,
the perfect hacker should have all the tools available, but tools are costly,
try to buy each version of every tool on Warez, you never know when it might be useful.

Using tools.
When you connect to a server and you have the correct tool, you'll see a message "[Tool] armed and ready!".
Defensive tools are automatically launched,
hacking or cracking tools need to be launched manually by typing the name of the tool at the right moment
(refer to the tool description on the store page).

Triad Servers reminder:
- karma.mother.net
- sutra.mother.net
- warez.mother.net

Have fun!
