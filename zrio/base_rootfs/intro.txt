What you are seeing is a limited chroot environment that should be able to connect to ZRIO servers (if they are still up).

Check your email with the "mail" command,
some of ZRIO stuff should be automated (meaning there's no real person behind it).

Who am I? Someone that was able to dump the internal ZRIO environment
before I was kicked out.

Take a look at the readme.txt file I left in your root folder,
just type "cat readme.txt", there's a small guide on how to use this environment.
