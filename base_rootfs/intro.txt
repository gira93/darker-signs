This is very old code, the fact you were able to run it is an achievement.

This is a limited chroot environment that should be able to connect to ZRIO servers
if they are still up.

Check your email with the "mail" command,
all ZRIO stuff should be automated (meaning there's no real person behind it)
UNLESS stated otherwise.

Maybe you can succeed where all the others failed.

Who am I? Someone that was able to dump the internal ZRIO code before they went down.

Take a look at the readme.txt file I left in your root folder,
just type "cat readme.txt", there's a small guide on how to use this environment.
